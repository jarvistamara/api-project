# RANDOM PROGRAMMING QUOTES - API
    For my first project at Flatiron, I used a random quotes api with could be found at:
    [API](http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/api)

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
    I used the following programming languages:
    - HTML
    - JAVASCRIPT
    - CSS
## HOW TO USE
    On start-up you will receive a random programming quote. You can then either save that first quote to your favorites by clicking on the designated "Add to Fav" button, or you can click the designated "Get New Quote" button to receive another random programming quote.

    If you choose to add some of the random quotes to your Favorites section, they will appear at the bottom of the page.
